  /**
   * Recovery strategy which redelivers messages a limited number of times. '''Violates message ordering guarantees.'''
   *
   * For a definition of what constitutes failure, see [[RecoveryStrategy]].
   *
   * In the event of a failure, the following happens:
   *
   *   - The message header [[x-retry `x-retry`]] is read to determine if there are retries remaining.
   *
   *   - If retries are exhausted, then fallback to provided `onAbandon` handler.
   *
   *   - Otherwise, publish a new copy of the message to the configurable, passively created `retryQueue`. It is of
   *     '''vital importance''' that you read the queue caveats related noted below.
   *
   *     - [[x-retry `x-retry`]] is incremented.
   *
   *     - The passive-queue definition is attempted at every retry. This leads to more IO but prevents the queue from
   *       expiring and basicPublish being none-the-wiser.
   *
   *     - The message copy is published using `channel.basicPublish`. Sometime after, using the same channel, the
   *       original message is acknowledged, using the same channel. This means two things:
   *
   *         1) The publish could succeed and the acknowledgement could fail, leading to a duplication of the
   *            message. An IO exception or network event at the right time could cause this.
   *
   *         2) In certain clustering configurations, it might be possible for the basicPublish to fail, but the
   *            acknowledgement to succeed. The failure case would require that the the message queue and the redelivery
   *            queue are on different cluster nodes, and that one can be reached but the other is not. Plan as
   *            needed. An implementation using transactions (slow) / asynchronous publisher confirms (faster) may be
   *            warranted.
   *
   *     - The message copy is re-inserted into the queue using the default (direct) exchange. This means that the
   *       second time around, if a direct-exchange wasn't used to initially route the message into the queue, then the
   *       routingKey will be modified. See the message header [[x-original-routing-key `x-original-routing-key`]] for
   *       the original routing key.
   *
   * == retryQueue passive creations CAVEATS!!! ==
   *
   * The retry queue is created passively. This allows the retryQueue to be used without error in the case of a
   * configuration change (in cases where a crash would be worse), but means that configuration changes done after the
   * initial creation of the queue will not propagate. As a result, if you want to guarantee that changes made to your
   * redelivery strategy propagate that you modify `retryQueueName` function such that it will create a new redelivery
   * queue. The old, unused one will expire, after an idle period of `redeliveryDelay * 3`.
   *
   * Also, it is vitally important that for every input queue-name of the `retryQueueName`, a unique value is returned.
   * In other words, '''DO NOT TRY AND CONSOLIDATE REDELIVERY QUEUES'''.
   *
   * @param redeliveryDelay The period after which the message should be re-inserted into the original queue.
   * @param retryCount The number of times to retry. A value of 3 will result in 4 attempts, including the initial.
   * @param onAbandon The strategy to be used once the retryCount is exhausted. Defaults to `nack(false)`.
   * @param retryQueue A function which, given some input queue name, returns the queue name to be used for retries. Must be a pure function. Must return a unique value for each input.
